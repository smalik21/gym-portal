# GYM Portal






## Project Overview

## Problem Statement
Payment receipts at many gyms are printed on paper, making it challenging to keep all receipts safe and accessible for both gym members and trainers. Misplacing paper receipts can cause issues for members. Additionally, manually distributing information about the gym's working and non-working days becomes difficult for gym owners. The GYM Management System aims to solve these problems by offering an online application that benefits both gym owners and members. By storing receipts digitally and providing automated notifications, the system ensures no confidential information is lost and keeps both members and owners informed.
